# BIQU-B1

I tried to compare the official (and outdated) firmware from BTT themselves and convert it to the new marlin 2.1.2 bugfix schema. I ended up just using the one provided from marlin since it is pretty good out of the box. Just needed to change to SKR V1.4 board

The firmware.bin file that I compiled is provided in this folder but feel free to check the code and compile your own firmware if you want
