# BIQU-B1

In config.ini,
- disabled touch screen sounds under "Sounds / Buzzer" 
- turned down brightness (100% -> 5%)
- enabled lcd lock
- changed progress display to percentage and time remaining
- decreased lcd idle timer (60s -> 30s)
- changed ack notifs from blocking popup to nonblocking toast
- hid file extensions in file names
- turned on filament runout sensor (off by default)
- turned on psu auto shutdown (i dont think this works tho)

Otherwise, it is the stock config files from BIQU
